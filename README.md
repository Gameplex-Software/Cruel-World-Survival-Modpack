Cruel World Survival is a survival/apocalypse based mod pack that focuses on a virus which was released during a conflict between nations, the virus has spread uncontrollably ever since. This pack is for EXPERIENCED PLAYERS, there is no active questing system to guide you through the pack, you have to figure it out all alone, just like you would in a real apocalypse. You and other players (as well as a population of rare NPCs spread throughout the planet) are immune to the virus but constantly assaulted by the new, hostile earth. It is your job to try to repopulate the earth and start society anew (More information in the "how to play" section).

### **Object of the game:**

Cruel World Survival is a hostile and unforgiving mod pack In which a virus has killed off a large portion of he population, as such your primary end-goal is to build your own city or restore the existing ones by clearing them of spawners, and then killing the armored mobs in haunted buildings. These armored mobs spawn regardless of light level and without any spawners, they will continue to spawn from any haunted building until you kill enough that chat tells you the building is safe. You must then seek out a village and play through the Minecraft Comes Alive mod which allows you to get married and have children and them to continue the cycle, repopulating your city. You must also keep the population of your city safe as the mutated creatures infected with the virus evolve into forms that can destroy blocks (except obsidian and bedrock). As your city continues to expand to cover the globe and the mobs get more and more brutal you will need better and better supplies of resources to combat them.
